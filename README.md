# Deep CNN Image Classifier

This image classification project is based on Nicholas Renotte's Deep CNN Classifier project. The main objective is to develop a robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification tasks using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Original Project

This project is inspired by Nicholas Renotte's [Deep CNN Classifier](https://github.com/nicknochnack/ImageClassification). I have adapted and extended the original concept to address a different problem domain and leverage a distinct dataset.

## Overview

- **Data Preprocessing:** Thorough data preprocessing techniques, including normalization and augmentation, were applied to ensure the quality of the dataset.
- **Model Architecture:** The CNN architecture consists of convolutional and dense layers, fine-tuned for binary image classification tasks.
- **Training and Evaluation:** The model underwent 25 epochs of training, achieving an impressive X% validation accuracy. Various evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy were assessed on a dedicated test set.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/deep-cnn-image-classifier.git
   cd deep-cnn-image-classifier
